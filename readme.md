# A Piano Roll in javascript

## Rationale

Recently I heard about the WebAudio API (not so recently actually, but I never found time to dive into it).

Recently, I also had to type some sheet music in Lilypond. While Lilypond is amazing, for typing a tune, I find the ABC
notation more intuitive, and piano roll graphical interfaces even more so.

In this small project, I want to be able to input notes using this piano roll, and it will output some Lilypond notes
and rhythms that I can then copy/paste into my Lilypond projects using the very cool Frescobaldi IDE.

This is just the beginningâ€¦ I've only spent some 3 hours on it (and probably a couple more daydreaming about it while
doing something else).
